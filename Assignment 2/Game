//What I learned - 
//This was the first time I had added scores together like this in Java, I had done it in python but when I tried the same techniques I would use, it got an error messeage. 
//I had to look to other sources (w3schools) to see how it was done in Java. 
//Also getting more comfortable using the scanners.
